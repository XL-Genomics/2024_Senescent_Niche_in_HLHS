### Ventricular Assist Device Unloading Reverses Microvascular Senescence in Single Ventricle Disease

Patients with hypoplastic left heart syndrome (HLHS) have an underdeveloped left ventricle and require multiple surgeries to reconfigure cardiac blood flow for survival. We studied myocardial microenvironment cell states using single nuclear RNA-sequencing and spatial transcriptomics on HLHS right ventricles at birth before heart failure develops; in post-surgical patients in heart failure; and in patients treated for heart failure by ventricular assist device (VAD), which unloads the heart and relieves hypoxia and volume overload. HLHS cardiomyocytes within the heart, as well as cardiomyocytes derived from induced pluripotent stem cells are senescent, indicating cardiomyocyte intrinsic senescence. Spatial transcriptomics revealed a microvasculature niche within capillary beds that contained hypoxic endothelial cells and pericytes and senescent cardiac fibroblasts with increased YAP activity, indicating a mechanically stressed and hypoxic microenvironment. This niche is similar to adult myocardial infarction but not pediatric dilated cardiomyopathy with heart failure pointing to a prominent role of hypoxia in senescence. The microvascular senescent niche was drastically improved by VAD providing insight into the potential to reverse cardiac cell states that lead to heart failure.

The computational framework includes: 
1) Initial snRNA-seq data set processing and QC.
2) Integration of single nucleus RNA seqeucning data and spatial transcriptomics data. Cell identity annotationa and visulization.
3) Data isualization for the published paper.
