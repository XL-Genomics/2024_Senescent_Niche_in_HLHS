## Senescent microvascular niche in hypoplastic left heart syndrome with heart failure

Hypoplastic left heart syndrome (HLHS) requires staged, palliative surgeries to reconfigure cardiac flow to relieve hypoxia and volume overload. Ventricular assist device (VAD) placement in patients who progress to heart failure (HF) addresses these issues. We performed single nuclear RNA-sequencing and spatial transcriptomics on HLHS right ventricles at birth before HF; in HF post-surgical palliation; and after VAD placement. We found senescence in HLHS hearts at birth. The HLHS heart is characterized by cardiomyocyte senescence, which was alleviated but incompletely reversed by VAD placement. Spatial transcriptomics revealed colocalization of a senescent microvasculature niche within capillary beds, which was reversed by VAD support. The senescent niche contained endothelial cells and pericytes with hypoxic and senescent cell signatures and senescent cardiac fibroblasts with increased YAP activity indicating a mechanically stressed microenvironment. This niche had similarities to the myocardial microenvironment in adult myocardial infarction but not pediatric dilated cardiomyopathy with HF. We identified a senescent microvasculature niche in HLHS with HF.

The computational framework includes: 
1) Initial processing of sequencing data and QC.
2) Integration of single nucleus RNA seqeucning data and spatial transcriptomics data. Cell identity annotationa and visulization.
3) Explorative investigation and visualization of omics datasets.
